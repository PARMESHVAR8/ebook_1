# 📘 Lecture 05: Essential Math for Statistics

This lecture lays the foundation of mathematical concepts essential to understanding statistics. Topics include coordinate geometry, linear and exponential functions, and basics of calculus.

## 📌 Key Concepts

### 📐 Number Line & Coordinate Geometry

- A number line represents a variable’s values.
- Cartesian plane: X-axis (independent), Y-axis (dependent).
- Linear equation: $Y = mX + C$, where:
  - $m = \frac{Y_2 - Y_1}{X_2 - X_1}$ (slope)
  - $C$ is the Y-intercept (Y when X = 0)

### 📊 Exponential Functions

- Form: $Y = a^X$ or $Y = e^X$ (where $e \approx 2.718$)
- Models rapid, nonlinear growth.

### 🧮 Differentiation

- Measures instantaneous rate of change:
  $$
  \frac{dY}{dX} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(X + h) - f(X)}{h}
  $$

### 📈 Integration

- Calculates area under the curve:
  $$
  \bar{X} = \int X \cdot f(X) \, dX
  $$

# 📘 Lecture 06: Measures of Central Tendency

Central tendency summarizes a dataset with a single representative value.

## 📌 Definitions

- **Mean**: Arithmetic average; sensitive to outliers.
- **Median**: Middle value; robust to outliers.
- **Mode**: Most frequent value; best for categorical data.

## 🔍 Characteristics

- Simple, uses all values (mean).
- Median is stable against extreme values.
- Mode is useful for nominal data.

## 💡 Suitability by Data Type

| Measure | Data Type      |
|--------|----------------|
| Mean   | Interval/Ratio |
| Median | Ordinal        |
| Mode   | Nominal        |

## 📉 Skewness

- Positive skew: Mean > Median
- Negative skew: Mean < Median

# 📘 Lecture 07: Measures of Variability

Describes the spread of data.

## 📌 Measures

- **Range**: Max - Min
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: $Q_3 - Q_1$
- **Variance**: Avg. of squared deviations
- **Standard Deviation (SD)**: $\sqrt{\text{Variance}}$
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: $\frac{SD}{Mean}$

## 📐 Theoretical Moments

| Moment | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| 1st    | Mean           |
| 2nd    | Variance       |
| 3rd    | Skewness       |
| 4th    | Kurtosis       |

# 📘 Lecture 08: Mean-Centered & Standardized Data

Transformation techniques for advanced analysis.

## 🧮 Mean-Centering

- Subtract mean from each data point.
- New mean becomes zero.

## 📊 Standardization (Z-Score)

- Formula: $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$
- Mean = 0, SD = 1
- Unitless; allows comparison across distributions.

## 📌 Applications

- Normalize different scales
- Preprocessing in statistics and ML

# 📘 Lecture 09: Introduction to Probability

Foundation of inferential statistics.

## 📌 Key Concepts

- **Experiment**: Controlled process
- **Event**: Subset of outcomes
- **Sample Space (S)**: All possible outcomes

## 📈 Basic Rule

- $P(A) = \frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}}$

## 🧠 Properties

- $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$
- $P(S) = 1$
- $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$
- If $A \subseteq B$, then $P(A) \leq P(B)$

## 🧮 Visual Aids

- Venn diagrams
- Frequency ↔ Probability distribution linkage

---

# 📘 Lecture 10: Distributions & Binomial Distribution

Probability distributions describe variable behavior.

## 🎲 Bernoulli Trials

- Success (p) or failure (1 – p)

## 📊 Binomial Distribution

- $n$ independent trials
- $$
  P(X = r) = \binom{n}{r} p^r (1-p)^{n-r}
  $$

## 📈 Properties

- Mean: $np$
- Variance: $np(1-p)$

## 🎮 Tools

- Galton board
- Pascal’s triangle

---

# 📘 Lecture 11: Normal Distribution

Crucial distribution in statistics.

## 📌 Characteristics

- Bell-shaped, symmetric about $\mu$
- Area under curve = 1
- Emerges with large samples

## 📉 Equation

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

## 🧮 Z-Score

- $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$

## 🔍 Empirical Rule

| Range        | Coverage |
|--------------|----------|
| ±1 SD        | 68%      |
| ±2 SD        | 95%      |
| ±3 SD        | 99.7%    |

## 📌 Applications

- Heights, test scores, measurement errors
