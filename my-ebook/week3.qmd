# Introduction

## Importance of Statistics

Statistics is a powerful tool used across disciplines — from economics and psychology to biology, data science, and machine learning. It enables:

- Interpretation of data
- Generalization from samples to populations
- Hypothesis testing and decision-making
- Prediction and modeling

Understanding statistics is essential for anyone involved in **empirical research**, **policy making**, **data-driven decision-making**, or **scientific inquiry**.

# Understanding Populations and Samples

## Population

The complete set of all units of interest. Examples:

- All students in India
- All electric cars in the U.S.

## Sample

A **subset of the population**, selected for analysis. Goal: represent the population accurately.

## Why Use Samples?

- More practical and cost-efficient
- Enables faster analysis
- Allows estimation and inference

## Relation Between Population & Sample

Population → Sample → Statistic → Inference → Population Parameter

---

# Hypotheses and Errors

## Hypothesis Defined

A hypothesis is a testable assumption about a population.

### Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)

- No difference or effect  
- Example: $H_0$: "μ = 100"

### Alternative Hypothesis ($H_A$)

- A difference or effect exists  
- Example: $H_A$: "μ ≠ 100"

## Types of Errors

| Error Type   | Description                                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Type I Error | Rejecting $H_0$ when it's true (false positive)     |
| Type II Error| Failing to reject $H_0$ when it's false (false neg) |

## Significance Level (α)

The probability of making a Type I error — commonly set to **0.05 (5%)**

---

# Inferential Statistics

## Purpose

- Estimate unknown population parameters
- Test hypotheses
- Predict outcomes

## Common Techniques

- t-test
- z-test
- ANOVA
- Chi-square
- Regression

---

## Sampling Techniques

### 1. Simple Random Sampling

Every unit has equal probability.

### 2. Systematic Sampling

Pick every kth element.

### 3. Stratified Sampling

Subdivide population into strata (e.g. age groups), then sample from each.

### 4. Cluster Sampling

Randomly choose entire groups (e.g. schools, cities).

---

## Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

If $n > 30$, the distribution of sample means approximates a **normal distribution** even if the original population is not normal.

Formula:

$$
Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
$$

---

# Descriptive Statistics

## Measures of Central Tendency

### Mean

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}
$$

### Median

Middle value in an ordered dataset.

### Mode

Most frequent value.

---

## Measures of Dispersion

### Range

$$
Range = Max - Min
$$

### Variance

$$
s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}
$$

### Standard Deviation

$$
s = \sqrt{s^2}
$$

---

## Measures of Shape

- **Skewness**: Degree of asymmetry
- **Kurtosis**: Peakedness of distribution

---

# Graphical Methods

## Histogram

r
hist(data$height, col="blue", main="Height Distribution")
Boxplot

boxplot(data$score ~ data$group)
Scatter Plot

plot(data$x, data$y, col="red")
Ogive (Cumulative Frequency Plot)

Built using cumulative frequency of class intervals.

## R Data Types and Structures

Basic Data Types

x <- 12.5         # numeric
y <- as.integer(5) # integer
z <- 4 + 3i        # complex
name <- "Ravi"     # character
flag <- TRUE       # logical
Vectors

v <- c(1, 2, 3)
Matrices

m <- matrix(1:9, nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)
Data Frame

df <- data.frame(Name=c("A", "B"), Score=c(89, 94))
Lists

lst <- list(id=101, name="John", marks=c(78, 82))
Factors

gender <- factor(c("Male", "Female", "Male"))
Statistical Fallacies

What are Fallacies?

Fallacies occur when conclusions are drawn based on flawed statistical reasoning.

Common Fallacies

Improper Sampling
Misleading Graphs
Ambiguous Term Definitions
Ignoring Confounding Variables
Assuming Correlation Implies Causation
Misuse of Statistics

Examples of Misuse

Using biased samples
Cherry-picking data
Using 3D pie charts to exaggerate results
Misrepresenting scale in graphs

# Linear Regression in R

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression models the relationship between a **dependent variable (Y)** and one or more **independent variables (X)**.

### Simple Linear Regression Equation:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon
$$

Where:

- $Y$ is the dependent variable  
- $X$ is the independent variable  
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept  
- $\beta_1$ is the slope  
- $\epsilon$ is the error term  

## Code Example

r
# Load data
data(mtcars)

# Fit model
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data=mtcars)

# Summary
summary(model)
 
## Adjusted R-squared

Penalizes the number of predictors to avoid overfitting.

AIC & BIC

AIC: Akaike Information Criterion
BIC: Bayesian Information Criterion
Lower values of AIC/BIC → better model fit (with penalty for complexity).

## Normal Distribution

Key Properties

Symmetrical, bell-shaped curve
Mean = Median = Mode
Total area under curve = 1
Empirical Rule:
68% within ±1 SD
95% within ±2 SD
99.7% within ±3 SD

Example:
Given: Mean = 70, SD = 5, X = 75

z <- (75 - 70) / 5  # Result: 1.0
Z-Table Usage

Find the area under the curve to the left of the z-score
Useful for probability and percentile ranking

## Data Import Techniques

CSV Import in R

df <- read.csv("data.csv", header=TRUE)
head(df)
Excel Import (using readxl)

library(readxl)

df <- read_excel("data.xlsx")
