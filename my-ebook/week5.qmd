# Practical Demonstration of ANOVA

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical technique used to compare the means of three or more groups. It helps to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of independent (unrelated) groups.

## Example Context

In this study, the fairness scores (proportion of money shared in a game) were collected from four different societal groups:

- Hunter-Gatherers (HG)
- Farmers (F)
- Natural Resource-based (NR)
- Industrial (I)

The data was:

| Group | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | Mean |
|-------|----|----|----|----|------|
| HG    | 28 | 36 | 38 | 31 | 33.25 |
| F     | 32 | 33 | 40 | —  | 35.00 |
| NR    | 47 | 43 | 52 | —  | 47.33 |
| I     | 40 | 47 | 45 | —  | 44.00 |

Total N = 13  
Grand Mean = 39.385

## Model (Between-Group) Sum of Squares (SSM)

1. Calculate the difference between the mean of each group and the grand mean.
2. Square each of these differences.
3. Multiply each result by the number of participants in that group.
4. Add the values for each group.

## Step-by-Step SSM Calculation (Between-Group)

**SSM (Model Sum of Squares)** is calculated as:

1. Calculate the difference between each group mean and the grand mean.
2. Square each of those differences.
3. Multiply the squared differences by the number of observations in each group (weighting).
4. Sum all the values.

## One-Way ANOVA Table

| Source   | SS     | df  | MS     | F    | p     |
|----------|--------|-----|--------|------|-------|
| Between  | 461.64 | 3   | 153.88 | 8.27 | <0.001 |
| Within   | 167.42 | 9   | 18.60  |      |       |
| Total    | 629.08 | 12  |        |      |       |

## Degrees of Freedom

- Between Groups: `k - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`
- Within Groups: `N - k = 13 - 4 = 9`
- Total: `N - 1 = 13 - 1 = 12`

## Example Dataset

Fairness score: proportion of money shared in a game

| Group         | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | Mean  | N |
|---------------|----|----|----|----|-------|---|
| Hunter-Gatherer | 28 | 36 | 38 | 31 | 33.25 | 4 |
| Farming       | 32 | 33 | 40 |    | 35.00 | 3 |
| Natural Res.  | 47 | 43 | 52 |    | 47.33 | 3 |
| Industrial    | 40 | 47 | 45 |    | 44.00 | 3 |

**Grand Mean**: 39.385

**F(3,9) = 8.27**, **p < .001**

# Lecture 2: Type of ANOVA

## Repeated Measures vs Between-Subjects ANOVA

| Aspect                     | Repeated Measures            | Between-Subjects              |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Experimental Design        | Same subjects, multiple conditions | Different groups, one condition |
| Dependency                 | Dependent                    | Independent                   |
| Statistical Power          | Lower (within variability)   | Higher (with more subjects)   |
| Control of Differences     | Each subject = own control   | Inter-subject differences     |
| Efficiency                 | Fewer subjects               | May need more subjects        |
| Example                    | Teaching improvement         | Compare teaching methods      |

## Foundations

- Repeated Measures → Paired Sample t-test  
- Between Subjects → Independent Sample t-test

## ANOVA Output Example

```r
summary(aov(Y ~ X))
```

| Source            | SS      | df | MS       | F       |
|-------------------|---------|----|----------|---------|
| Between-Subjects  | 86.667  | 2  | 43.3335  | 2.3552  |
| Within-Subjects   | 1600    | 87 | 18.3908  |         |
| Total             | 1686.667| 89 |          |         |

```r

| Objective     | Group differences in multivariate response      | Interaction and main effects                     |
| Assumptions   | Multivariate normality, equal covariances       | Normality, homogeneous variances                 |

```r
# Two-way ANOVA in R
model <- aov(Yield ~ Treatment * Dose, data = data)
summary(model)

## Uses of Correlation

- Grouping similar variables
- Reliability analysis

# Lecture 5: Regression Continued

## Linear Regression

- Predict the value of a **dependent variable (Y)** using an **independent variable (X)**.

## Nonlinear Regression

- For non-linear data relationships.
- Often uses machine learning methods for non-parametric models.

## Example Equations

```r
# Regression Coefficients
b = SSxy / SSxx
a = ȳ - b * x̄
```

```r
# Regression Analysis
SST = Σ(y − ȳ)² = SSyy
R² = 1 - (SSE / SST)
DF_regression = 1
DF_total = n - 1
```
