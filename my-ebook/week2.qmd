# 2. Types of Data

## 2.1 Classification of Data

| Type           | Example              | Description                     |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Qualitative    | Gender, Nationality  | Non-numeric labels              |
| Quantitative   | Height, Age          | Numeric values                  |
| Discrete       | No. of Children      | Countable numbers               |
| Continuous     | Temperature, Weight  | Infinite values in a range      |

### 2.1.1 Qualitative (Categorical) Data

- **Nominal:** No inherent order (e.g., religion, marital status).
- **Ordinal:** Natural order (e.g., customer satisfaction: Poor, Average, Good).

### 2.1.2 Quantitative (Numerical) Data

- **Discrete:** Integers; e.g., number of books.
- **Continuous:** Measurable; e.g., weight in kilograms.

---

# 3. Descriptive Statistics

## 3.1 Measures of Central Tendency

### 3.1.1 What is Central Tendency?

Central tendency refers to the center or middle of a dataset. It's the value that best represents the entire distribution.

### 3.1.2 Characteristics of a Good Measure

- Rigidly defined
- Easy to understand
- Takes all data into account
- Amenable to algebraic treatment
- Stable under sampling
- Minimally affected by outliers (except mean)

---

## 3.2 The Mean

### 3.2.1 Definition

The arithmetic mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.

### 3.2.2 Formula

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}
$$

### 3.2.3 Properties of Mean

- Uses all data values
- Affected by extreme values
- The sum of deviations from the mean is zero

### 3.2.4 Example

Data: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30  
Mean = $(10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30)/5 = 20$

---

## 3.3 The Median

### 3.3.1 Definition

The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample.

### 3.3.2 Calculation

- Odd number of items: Middle value
- Even number of items: Average of the two middle values

### 3.3.3 Properties

- Not influenced by extreme values
- Best for skewed data

### 3.3.4 Example

Data: 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 21, 33  
Median = 12 (middle value)

---

## 3.4 The Mode

### 3.4.1 Definition

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.

### 3.4.2 Characteristics

- Can be used for categorical data
- Dataset can be unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal
- May not exist if all values are unique

### 3.4.3 Example

Data: 4, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 4  
Mode = 4

---

## 3.5 Comparison Table

| Measure | Use Case                 | Affected by Outliers | Mathematical Use |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Mean    | Symmetric distributions  | Yes                  | High             |
| Median  | Skewed distributions     | No                   | Moderate         |
| Mode    | Categorical variables    | No                   | Low              |

---

# 4. Measures of Variability

## 4.1 Why Measure Variability?

While central tendency summarizes data, variability tells us how spread out the data is. It’s essential in determining consistency and reliability.

---

## 4.2 Range

### 4.2.1 Definition

The difference between the maximum and minimum values.

$$
\text{Range} = x_{\text{max}} - x_{\text{min}}
$$

### 4.2.2 Example

Data: 12, 14, 17, 19, 23  
Range = 23 - 12 = 11

### 4.2.3 Limitations

- Ignores distribution shape
- Extremely sensitive to outliers

---

## 4.3 Quartiles and Interquartile Range

### 4.3.1 Quartiles

- Q1 (25th percentile): Lower quartile
- Q2 (50th percentile): Median
- Q3 (75th percentile): Upper quartile

### 4.3.2 Formula for Position

$$
Q_k = \frac{k(n+1)}{4}
$$

### 4.3.3 IQR Formula

$$
IQR = Q3 - Q1
$$

### 4.3.4 Example

Data: 12, 30, 45, 57, 70  
Q1 = 30, Q3 = 57 → IQR = 27

---

## 4.4 Variance

### 4.4.1 Concept

Variance is the average of the squared differences from the Mean.

### 4.4.2 Formulas

**Population Variance:**

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum (x_i - \mu)^2
$$

**Sample Variance:**

$$
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

---

## 4.5 Standard Deviation

### 4.5.1 Concept

Standard deviation is the square root of variance. It provides a measure of spread in the same units as the data.

$$
s = \sqrt{s^2}
$$

### 4.5.2 Properties

- Same unit as original data
- Measures how far values deviate from the mean
- Widely used in most statistical computations

---

## 4.6 Coefficient of Variation (CV)

### 4.6.1 Definition

The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage. Used to compare variability between datasets with different units.

$$
CV = \left( \frac{s}{\bar{x}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

### 4.6.2 Example

Dataset A: Mean = 100, SD = 10 → CV = 10%  
Dataset B: Mean = 50, SD = 5 → CV = 10%

---

## 4.7 Moment-Based Measures

- First Moment (about mean): 0 (since $\sum (x - \bar{x}) = 0$)
- Second Moment: Variance
- Third Moment: Skewness
- Fourth Moment: Kurtosis

---

# 5. Probability Fundamentals

## 5.1 Introduction to Probability

Probability is the mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty. It helps us estimate how likely an event is to occur.

## 5.2 Key Definitions

- **Experiment:** A process that leads to an outcome.
- **Outcome:** The result of an experiment.
- **Sample Space (Ω):** All possible outcomes.
- **Event:** A subset of the sample space.

---

## 5.3 Types of Events

| Event Type              | Description                                       |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Independent             | Occurrence of one does not affect the other      |
| Dependent               | One affects the outcome of another               |
| Mutually Exclusive      | Cannot occur together                            |
| Exhaustive              | Includes all possible outcomes                   |

---

## 5.4 Classical Probability

Used when all outcomes are equally likely.

**Formula:**
$$
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes in } \Omega}
$$

**Example:** Rolling a fair die  
P(rolling a 3) = 1/6

---

## 5.5 Probability Rules

### Rule 1: Non-Negativity

$$
0 \leq P(A) \leq 1
$$

### Rule 2: Total Probability

$$
P(\Omega) = 1
$$

### Rule 3: Complement Rule

$$
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
$$

### Rule 4: Addition Rule

If A and B are mutually exclusive:

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$

Otherwise:

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$

### Rule 5: Multiplication Rule

- For independent events:  
$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
$$

---

## 5.6 Conditional Probability

**Formula:**

$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$

---

# 6. Discrete Probability Distributions

## 6.1 Bernoulli Distribution

- One trial, two outcomes (success/failure).
- Success = 1, Failure = 0

$$
P(X = x) = p^x (1 - p)^{1 - x}, \quad x \in \{0,1\}
$$

- Mean = $p$
- Variance = $p(1 - p)$

### Example:

Flip a fair coin → p = 0.5  
Mean = 0.5, Variance = 0.25

---

## 6.2 Binomial Distribution

- Series of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials
- Number of successes $x$ out of $n$ trials

**Formula:**

$$
P(X = x) = \binom{n}{x} p^x (1 - p)^{n - x}
$$

- Mean: $\mu = np$
- Variance: $\sigma^2 = np(1 - p)$

### Example:

Flip a coin 5 times (p = 0.5)  
P(X = 3) = $\binom{5}{3} (0.5)^3 (0.5)^2 = 10 \cdot 0.125 \cdot 0.25 = 0.3125$

---

# 7. Continuous Distributions

## 7.1 Normal Distribution

The most important continuous distribution in statistics.

**Properties:**

- Bell-shaped and symmetric
- Defined by mean (μ) and variance (σ²)
- Total area under the curve = 1

**Probability Density Function (PDF):**

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \exp \left( -\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
$$

### Empirical Rule:

- 68% of values lie within ±1σ
- 95% within ±2σ
- 99.7% within ±3σ

---

## 7.2 Standard Normal Distribution

A normal distribution with:

- Mean = 0
- Standard deviation = 1

**Z-score Formula:**

$$
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

### Example:

If $\mu = 100$, $\sigma = 15$, and $X = 130$  
Then $Z = \frac{130 - 100}{15} = 2$

---

# 8. Visualizing Data

## 8.1 Frequency Distribution

| Class Interval | Frequency |
|----------------|-----------|
| 0–10           | 3         |
| 11–20          | 7         |
| 21–30          | 9         |
| 31–40          | 6         |

---

## 8.2 Histogram
