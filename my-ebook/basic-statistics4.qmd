# Introduction

This eBook serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding basic statistics, focusing particularly on concepts pertinent to the use of GUI-R (RK Ward). It combines theoretical knowledge with practical applications, allowing readers to engage with statistical analysis effectively.

# Course Overview

## Course Name

**Basic Statistics using GUI-R (RKWard)**

## Instructor Profile

Dr. Harsh Pradhan is an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Management Studies, Banaras Hindu University. He specializes in statistical methods and data analysis techniques. For a complete overview of his work, refer to his [BHU Faculty Profile](https://bhu.ac.in/Site/FacultyProfile/1_5?FA000562).

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply fundamental statistical concepts.
- Perform T-tests and ANOVA using real data.
- Calculate and interpret confidence intervals.
- Utilize GUI-R for statistical analysis effectively.

# Fundamental Statistical Concepts

## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the features of a dataset.

### Measures of Central Tendency

- **Mean**: Average value calculated by summing observations and dividing by the number of observations.
- **Median**: The middle value when the data is ordered. If there is an even number of observations, it is the average of the two middle values.
- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.

#### Example Calculation

Given the data set: `[4, 8, 6, 5, 3]`

- **Mean**: $(4 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 3) / 5 = 5.2$
- **Median**: Ordered data [3, 4, 5, 6, 8], median is 5.
- **Mode**: No mode (all values are unique).

### Measures of Dispersion

- **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.
- **Variance**: The average of the squared differences from the Mean.
- **Standard Deviation (SD)**: The square root of variance, showing how much variation exists from the mean.

#### Example Table of Measures

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mean      | 5.2   |
| Median    | 5     |
| Mode      | N/A   |
| Range     | 5     |
| Variance  | 3.52  |
| SD        | 1.88  |

## Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics involves making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data.

### Hypothesis Testing

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: A statement asserting there is no effect or difference.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: A statement indicating the presence of an effect or difference.

### Confidence Intervals

A confidence interval (CI) provides a range of values likely to contain the population parameter (e.g., mean) with a certain level of confidence (usually 95%).

**Formula**:

$$
CI = \bar{x} \pm Z \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Where:
- $\bar{x}$ = sample mean  
- $Z$ = Z-score for the desired confidence level  
- $s$ = standard deviation of the sample  
- $n$ = sample size  

### Types of Errors

- **Type I Error**: Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (false positive).
- **Type II Error**: Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false (false negative).

# The Student T-Test

## Introduction to T-Test

The T-test is a hypothesis test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.

## Types of T-Tests

- **Independent T-Test**: Compares means of two independent groups.
- **Paired T-Test**: Compares means of two related groups.
- **One-sample T-Test**: Tests the mean from a single group against a known mean.

## Performing T-Tests

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **State the Hypotheses**:
   - H₀: $\mu_1 = \mu_2$  
   - H₁: $\mu_1 \neq \mu_2$  

2. **Calculate the T-statistic**:
   $$
   t = \frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}
   $$

3. **Degrees of Freedom**:
   $$
   df = n_1 + n_2 - 2
   $$

4. **Find the P-value** from statistical tables or software.

5. **Make a Decision**: If p < 0.05, reject H₀.

## Assumptions of the T-Test

- Normal distribution.
- Independent groups (for independent T-tests).
- Equal variances.

## Example: Independent T-Test

| Group   | Mean | SD | n  |
|---------|------|----|----|
| Group A | 78   | 10 | 30 |
| Group B | 85   | 12 | 30 |

**Calculation**:

$$
t = \frac{78 - 85}{\sqrt{\frac{10^2}{30} + \frac{12^2}{30}}} \approx -2.53
$$

## T-Test in GUI-R

- Open GUI-R and import your dataset.
- Select 'T-Test' from the menu.
- Define groups.
- Run the test and interpret the output.

# Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

## Introduction

ANOVA compares means among 3+ groups to determine if at least one is different.

## One-Way ANOVA

Involves one independent variable.

### Steps:

1. **Hypotheses**:
   - H₀: All group means equal.
   - H₁: At least one group mean is different.

2. **Calculate F-statistic**:

$$
F = \frac{MS_{Between}}{MS_{Within}}
$$

3. **Degrees of Freedom**:
   - $df_{Between} = k - 1$
   - $df_{Within} = N - k$

## Example Table

| Group   | Mean | Variance | n  |
|---------|------|----------|----|
| Group 1 | 5.5  | 1.5      | 30 |
| Group 2 | 7.1  | 2.0      | 30 |
| Group 3 | 6.8  | 1.8      | 30 |

### Summary Table

| Source         | SS    | df | MS   | F    |
|----------------|-------|----|------|------|
| Between Groups | 42.4  | 2  | 21.2 | 5.24 |
| Within Groups  | 122.7 | 87 | 1.41 |      |
| Total          | 165.1 | 89 |      |      |

## ANOVA in GUI-R

- Import data.
- Choose ANOVA.
- Define variables.
- Run and interpret.

# Confidence Intervals

## Concept

Shows likely range for population parameter.

## Formula

$$
CI = \bar{x} \pm Z \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

## Example

Sample Mean = 100, SD = 15, n = 30, Z = 1.96

$$
CI = 100 \pm 1.96 \times \frac{15}{\sqrt{30}} \approx [98.04, 101.96]
$$

# Practical Applications in GUI-R

## GUI-R Overview

GUI-based interface for R statistical computing.

## Workflow

1. Import Data (CSV/Excel).
2. Choose Statistical Test.
3. Run & Analyze Results.
4. Export or visualize.

## Case Studies

- **T-Test**: Compare test scores from two teaching methods.
- **ANOVA**: Evaluate effect of 3 different drugs on recovery rate.

# Conclusion

Mastering statistics and GUI-R helps researchers interpret and communicate data insights. T-tests, ANOVA, and confidence intervals are foundational tools, and GUI-R provides an accessible environment for applying them.
