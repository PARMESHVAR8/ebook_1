## Meaning of Statistics

Statistics is a science which provides tools for **analysis and interpretation** of raw data collected for decision-making in diverse fields.

It includes four core concepts:

- **Population** â€“ Complete data or total group
- **Sample** â€“ Subset of population
- **Parameter** â€“ Numerical summary from population
- **Statistic** â€“ Numerical summary from sample

## Nature of Statistics

- Deals with **numerical facts**
- Focused on **social phenomena** and real-world data
- Organizes, classifies, and analyzes data
- Facilitates **prediction**, **interpretation**, and **decision-making**

---

## Uses of Statistics

- Drawing representative samples
- Summarizing collected data
- Tabulation and systematic arrangement
- Group comparisons
- Determining behavioral relationships
- Estimating chance vs causation
- Application in:
  - Psychology
  - Education
  - Employment surveys
  - Market Research
  - Industrial and Organizational studies


## Limitations of Statistics

- Cannot study **qualitative phenomena** without quantification
- Not applicable to individuals
- **Statistical laws are not exact**
- Does not guarantee **causal relationships**
- Vulnerable to misuse

## Misuse of Statistics

- Use of extremely **small or biased** samples
- **Misleading graphs** or visual misrepresentation
- Illogical or **unexpected comparisons**


## Fallacies in Statistics

Fallacies may arise from:

- Poor data collection methods
- Vague or manipulated term definitions
- Improper unit selection
- Faulty classification or grouping
- Inappropriate statistical methods

# Module 4: Understanding Variables

## What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a characteristic or attribute that can assume different values across individuals or items.

In statistics, variables are categorized for analysis and measurement.

### R Definition:

In R, variables are containers for data, created by assignment:

```r
x <- 10
name <- "Harsh"
flag <- TRUE

Classification of Variables

A. Qualitative (Categorical)

Type	Description	Example

Nominal	Categories without order	Gender (Male, Female)
Ordinal	Categories with a meaningful order	Education Level (UG, PG)


B. Quantitative (Numerical)

Type	Description	Example

Discrete	Countable numbers	No. of students
Continuous	Infinite values in a range	Height, Weight


Statistical Data Types (Scale of Measurement)

Data Type	Description	Examples

Nominal	Categories with no order	Blood group (A, B, AB, O)
Ordinal	Ranked categories	Satisfaction (Low, Med, High)
Interval	Numeric scale with no true zero	Temperature in Celsius
Ratio	Numeric scale with true zero	Income, Weight, Age

Data Types in R

R Type	Description	Example Code

Numeric	Real numbers	x <- 15.3
Integer	Whole numbers	y <- as.integer(10)
Complex	Real + imaginary	z <- 2+3i
Character	Text strings	c <- "hello"
Logical	Boolean values	b <- TRUE
Factor	Categorical encoding	factor(c("yes", "no", "yes"))


# Examples in R
x <- 15.6
y <- as.integer(18)
z <- 7 + 5i
c <- "I am OK"
b <- TRUE


Module 5: Data Structures in R

Vectors

A vector is a one-dimensional array of elements.

vec1 <- c(5, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 1, 4, 10, 15)

Matrices

Two-dimensional arrays of rows and columns.

mat <- matrix(1:9, nrow=3, ncol=3)

Arrays

Multidimensional generalization of matrices.

arr <- array(1:24, dim=c(3,4,2))

Lists

Collection of different types of elements.

mylist <- list(name="Alice", age=30, scores=c(89,90))

Data Frames

Tabular data (like a spreadsheet), each column can have a different type.

df <- data.frame(ID=1:3, Name=c("A", "B", "C"), Score=c(85, 90, 95))

Factors

Used for categorical variables.

gender <- factor(c("Male", "Female", "Male"))

Module 6: Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize and simplify data.

Central Tendency

Measure	Formula	Meaning

Mean	$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$	Average
Median	Middle value in sorted data	Central observation
Mode	Most frequent value	Most common observation


Dispersion Measures

Measure	Formula	Purpose

Range	$Range = Max - Min$	Spread of data
Variance	$s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}$	Spread from mean
Standard Deviation	$s = \sqrt{Variance}$	Average distance from mean


Example in R

x <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
mean(x)
median(x)
var(x)
sd(x)

Module 7: Inferential Statistics

Inferential stats allow us to make conclusions about populations using samples.

Key Concepts

Hypothesis Testing: Assesses assumptions about a population.

Confidence Intervals: Estimate population parameters within a range.

Significance Levels (Î±): Commonly 0.05 or 5%

P-Value: Probability of observing the data assuming the null is true.


Hypothesis Types

Type	Description

Null Hypothesis	No difference / no effect
Alternative	There is a difference / effect


R Examples

t.test(x)                 # One-sample t-test
t.test(x, y)              # Two-sample t-test

Module 8: Visualizing Data

Data visualization helps uncover patterns and insights.

Boxplot

Shows 5-number summary

Identifies outliers


boxplot(x)

Histogram

Frequency distribution of continuous data


hist(x)

Pie Chart

Shows proportion in categories


slices <- c(10, 12, 4, 16, 8)
labels <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")
pie(slices, labels=labels)

Scatter Plot

Relationship between two variables


plot(x, y)

Ogive (Cumulative Frequency)

# Create cumulative frequency table manually

Module 9: Spreadsheet Basics

Spreadsheets like Excel or Google Sheets are entry points for data work.

Key Features:

Rows â†’ Observations

Columns â†’ Variables

Supports sorting, filtering

Built-in formulas: =SUM(), =AVERAGE(), etc.

Spreadsheets vs R

Feature	Spreadsheet (Excel, GSheets)	R / RKWard

Cost	Usually licensed	Free and open source
Flexibility	Limited to GUI formulas	Full programming capability
Graphics	Basic	Advanced (ggplot2)
Reproducibility	Low	High (script-based)

Module 10: Command Line vs GUI

Command Line (R Console)

# Windows Command Line
cd ..
mkdir new_folder
dir

R Console Commands

getwd()
setwd("path")
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

GUI (RKWard)

Point-and-click interface

No coding needed

View script history and console

Menu for graphs, models, tables
