    "section": "24.1 📘Summary: Basic Statistics using GUI-R (RKWard)",
    "text": "24.1 📘Summary: Basic Statistics using GUI-R (RKWard)\nThis eBook, authored by Dr. Harsh Pradhan (Assistant Professor at the Institute of Management Studies, Banaras Hindu University), serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and applying basic statistical concepts, particularly in the GUI-based software RKWard (GUI-R).\nKey Highlights: 1. Descriptive Statistics Covers measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and variability (range, variance, standard deviation). Introduces standard error and its role in estimating population parameters. 2. Inferential Statistics Introduces the Central Limit Theorem and how it forms the foundation for many statistical techniques. Confidence intervals are explained both theoretically and with practical calculations. 3. T-Tests (Student’s t) Explains one-sample, independent-sample, and paired-sample t-tests. Includes step-by-step computation and GUI-R implementation. Includes interpretation of p-values, degrees of freedom, and test statistics. 4. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) Covers one-way, two-way, and repeated measures ANOVA. Focuses on the F-statistic, assumptions, and post-hoc analyses. Discusses partitioning of variance into systematic and unsystematic components. 5. Effect Size and Statistical Power Introduces Cohen’s d, eta-squared, and power analysis. Emphasizes that statistical significance does not always imply practical importance. 6. Assumption Testing Tests for normality (Shapiro-Wilk, QQ plot). Tests for homogeneity of variance (Levene’s test). Highlights when to use non-parametric alternatives. 7. Non-Parametric Tests Introduces Wilcoxon signed-rank, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests as robust alternatives to parametric methods. 8. Data Visualization in R Demonstrates use of boxplots, histograms, and density plots using ggplot2. Provides example R code for reproducibility. 9. GUI-R (RKWard) Usage Offers practical steps for using GUI-R for all statistical techniques covered. Designed to bridge the gap for learners unfamiliar with command-line R.",
